# Image Compression 

There are some good references with pre-trained model which will be helpful in image compression 

## DenseNet

* Tensorflow with Keras engine (from Tensorflow) [link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.7/tensorflow/python/keras/_impl/keras/applications/densenet.py).

* Tensorflow with tensorpack (from YixuanLi) [link](https://github.com/YixuanLi/densenet-tensorflow/blob/master/cifar10-densenet.py). No pre-trained model. Easy to read and implement with tensorpack api.

* Tensorflow with Keras engine (from flyyuflix) [link](https://github.com/flyyufelix/DenseNet-Keras). With pre-trained models. 

## Fully Convolution DenseNet

* Pure Tensorflow (from GeorgeSeif) [link](https://github.com/GeorgeSeif/Semantic-Segmentation-Suite/blob/master/models/FC_DenseNet_Tiramisu.py). Easy to read.

* Theano and Lasagne (from author SimJeg) [link](https://github.com/SimJeg/FC-DenseNet.

* Tensorflow with Keras engine (from 0bserver07) [link](https://github.com/0bserver07/One-Hundred-Layers-Tiramisu). No pre-trained model. Has tool to convert whole data set to one data files (.npy) to faster training.
